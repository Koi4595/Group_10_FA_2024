    "From our analysis, we were able to get some insight into our original research questions:\n",

    "\n",
    "- How do job requirements vary across different industries?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How could job hunters with different background find suitable jobs?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. In our **descriptive statistics** part,we analyzed salaries for these occupations，chose median salary as our basis of salary analysis, identified common skill requirements across industries (e.g., information technology and data analytics skills are valued across multiple fields), and conducted a preliminary analysis of the types and fundamentals of employer industry sectors across the job market, as well as the potential intensity of competition in the job market. \n",
    "  2. In our **Inferential statistics** part, we used Kruskal-Wallis H Test to analyze if there is a statistically significant difference in median salary between different skill categories. The hypothesis test was validated, indicating that different skill categories do affect salaries, with industries associated with Technical & Engineering and Legal & Compliance skills having relatively higher salaries, while Business and Administration skills possess significantly less salary level. \n",
    "  3. The **graphical statistics** part：We created 3 types of charts to describe and analyze our dataset in a comprehensive way: 1.Using wordcloud map to get the keywords in skill categories and industry names. 2. Using bar charts to count the 20 hottest skills in the job market. 3. Using heat maps to count the correlation between the hottest skills and the industrial sector that the job belongs to, to find the hottest pairings.\n",
    "  4. In our **comparative statistics**, we 1. compare the types of skills required for jobs in companies of different sizes, revealing more visually the differences in job skill preferences between small and large companies. 2. created boxplots with the number of employees, the number of followers, and the ratio of employees/followers of the firms belonging to the different industrial sectors We created box plots of the number of employees, followers, and employee/follower ratio of companies belonging to different industrial sectors to more visually analyze which companies are receiving more attention in the job market.\n",
    "  5. We used industry, salary level and skill categories in our **multivariable statistics**, looking for correlations between salary, type of skill and the type of industry the company belongs to, our results indicate that many jobs having a high salary needs multiple skills that may not suitable for new job hunters, and otherwise, the best-paying skill types are Technical & Engineering, Finance, and Business."

For example, the multiple industry fields in this huge dataset makes it hard to visualize. It was difficult to validate individually and filter them out. Also how to choose the variables and to make our analysis work as well as it should is also a difficult process. But finally we solved those problems. \n",
